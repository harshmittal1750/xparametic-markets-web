# Polkamarkets

Polkamarkets is an Autonomous Prediction Market Protocol built for multi-chain information exchange and trading, based on Polkadot.

## Overview

Our web interface is built with React.

We're currently running on [Moonbeam](https://moonbeam.network/) and [Moonriver](https://moonbeam.network/networks/moonriver/). You can access it at [https://app.polkamarkets.com](https://app.polkamarkets.com)
